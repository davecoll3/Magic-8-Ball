# The Magic 8 Ball

The Magic 8 Ball is used for fortune telling or seeking advice. This is a fun website where users can ask a question and receive a response that affirms or rejects their query; it can also provide a neutral response.

The primary technologies used to form the basis of this website are the coding languages HTML, CSS and JavaScript which were complemented by use of the Bootstrap framework.

# UX and UI

## Research

* [Origami Fortune Teller](https://www.horoscope.com/us/games/divination/game-origami-fortune-teller.aspx)
* [Ask the Crystal Ball](https://www.crystalballfree.com/)
* [Magic 8 Ball](https://legomenon.com/ask-magic-8-ball-game-online.html)
* [Fortune Cookie](https://fortune-telling-online.com/readings/free-oracles-and-games/fortune-cookie/)
* [Cuppy Fortune Teller](https://www.buzzfeed.com/morgansloss1/this-interactive-fortune-telling-quiz-will-predict-your)

&nbsp;

## Owner Goals

  * Create a short but fun advice/fortune telling game.
  * To generate interest in their games.
  * Potentially generate enough traffic to attract advertisers.

&nbsp;

## User Stories

### First Time Visitor

  * As a first time user, I want to understand the main purpose of the site.
  * As a first time user, I want to easily understand how the game works.
  * As a first time user, I want feedback if I am doing something wrong.

### Returning Visitor

  * As a returning user, I want to be easily able to replay the game.
  * As a returning user, I want to be able to quickly identify who produced the website/game.

&nbsp;

## User Requirements and Expectations

### Requirements

  * Familiar and intuitive design that negates any learning curve.
  * A reactive site that is user friendly and well presented on all types of device and screen sizes.
  * An easy and logical means of playing the game.
  * Adequate levels of color contrast across the site that presents content in an accessible and easy to read manner.
  * Appealing graphics and animations that enhance the user experience.

### Expectations

  * Feedback when interacting with the game that is also instructive. 
  * Clicking on the "Shake!" button should result in a shake effect on the Magic 8 Ball.
  * A response should be displayed once a question has been submitted.

&nbsp;

## Design

###Â Imagery
* An image of the Orion Nebula was used to create a visual link to mysticism that is intrinsically conected to space and space iconography. It has a vibrant, colourful aesthetic that is visually appealing. 

### Color Scheme

* Black and white colours were used on the Eight Ball as is traditional. White, black and grey text was used across the site to provide good contrast; adhering to the WCAG 2.1 contrast guidelines. Magenta, cyan, and white was used to help blend the Eight Ball into the background image. In keeping with this theme, various shades of purple were used on the "Shake!" button and on the back area of the Eight Ball itself to provide some shading and make it seem less two dimensional.

### Fonts

* The Google font of Nunito was chosen as it is a well balanced typeface with a slightly rounded edge which fits in with the overall look of the site, providing good definition without detracting form the imagary.

### Structure

* This is a single-product website that does not require any navigation links. In the future, this site could be incorporated into a multi-page website containing additional games or content.

&nbsp;

## Wireframes

* Balsamiq Wireframes was used to create the wireframes for this site. 
Wireframes for mobile, tablet, and desktop can be found below:

  ### [Mobile Wireframe](/readme-files/wireframes/mobile-wireframes.pdf)

  ### [Tablet Wireframe](/readme-files/wireframes/tablet-wireframes.pdf)
